# TODO for Registration Form Enhancement

- [x] Fix input field IDs in screens/register/index.html to be unique and meaningful (regNumber, firstName, middleName, lastName, department, studentEmail, photo)
- [x] Create screens/register/register.js to handle form submission, collect input values, create student object, and add to localStorage sessions
- [x] Add script tag for register.js in screens/register/index.html
- [x] Test registration functionality to ensure new students are added to sessions
